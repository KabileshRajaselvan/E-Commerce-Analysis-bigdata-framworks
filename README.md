# 📊 BDF Review: Benford's Law Fraud Detection

## 🧾 Overview

This project applies **Benford's Law** to detect potential fraudulent activity in financial or transactional data. The analysis is conducted using a Jupyter Notebook (`BDF_review.ipynb`) which includes data processing, visualization, and statistical testing to identify anomalies that deviate from expected digit distributions.

Benford's Law states that in many naturally occurring datasets, the leading digits are not uniformly distributed. This law can be leveraged in forensic analytics to identify suspicious or manipulated data.
